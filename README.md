# Graduate-Admission-Predictor
Graduate Admission Predictor built using Deep Neural Network. This was my research project during the second year as a Computer Science student minoring in Artificial Intelligence.

The dataset was taken from Kaggle, titled the “Graduate Admissions” posted by Mohan S. Acharya in April 2018.
