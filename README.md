# Graduate-Admission-Predictor
Graduate Admission Predictor built using Deep Neural Network. This is a research project done during my second year as a student minoring in Artificial Intelligence.

The dataset was taken from Kaggle, titled the “Graduate Admissions” posted by Mohan S. Acharya in April 2018.
